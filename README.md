# identification-of-tiny-insects

This repository provides original pictures and supplementary video for Takimoto et al. "Using a two-stage convolutional neural network to rapidly identify tiny herbivorous beetles in the field."

### Pictures
  
**photographs** folder includes original pictures generated by our own fieldwork.  
Sub-folders include  
  /bg: background pictures without flea beetles    
  /both: pictures including both *P. striolata* and *P. atra*  
  /P.atra: pictures including *P. atra*  
  /P.striolata: pictures including *P. striolata*    
  
  
### Supplementary Video  
  
- S1_annotated_test_movie.mp4  
Field video including manual annotations of *P. striolata* and *P. atra* used as a ground truth.
  
- S2_result_of_re-identification(with_classified_background).mp4  
Video results of re-identification by the two-stage CNN method. Re-identified background objects are included.
  
- S3_result_of_re-identification(without_classified_background).mp4  
Video results of re-identification by the two-stage CNN method. The insect regions are shown without background objects.
